If you happen to stumble upon this project let me tell you.

I fucking abandon it.

The reason is React Native suck (kinda) and mostly because the ZTT guy who fucking taught this course or project

It is fucking 4 years old so when i try to apply the latest method to do these kind of things

I happen to ran into hundred, millions of bugs which is fucking annoying and make me realise how shitty React Native is

So i'm abandoning it all. This will be the history of one of the worst framework i ever work with

I will pursue either .NET MAUI or Kotlin Multiplatform not this pathetic shit

Thanks for reading my yapping, you can leave now
